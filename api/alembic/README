To generate a new migration based on changes in your models, run:

    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"

This will create a new migration file in alembic/versions with a name that includes a hash and your description. Review the generated migration file to ensure the changes are correct and safe.

To apply the migrations to your database, use:

    alembic upgrade head

This will apply all pending migrations up to the most recent one (denoted as "head").

If you need to revert the last applied migration, you can use:

    alembic downgrade -1

And to revert multiple migrations, you can specify the number of revisions you wish to revert instead of -1.
